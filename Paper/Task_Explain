In this appendix, I will explain how I separated the mandate tasks found in \citep{lloyd2021} into the categories of risky and less risky. I classify mandate tasks as ``risky" when the physical integrity of the peacekeepers are more likely to be in jeopardy when carrying out that task. Below, I tackle the explanation of each main task classified in Table \ref{Table 1} as well as their respective subtasks where available. 

\subsection*{Monitoring Peace Agreements}

The main task of monitoring a peace agreement and its subtasks of monitoring the buffer zone and  liaising war parties are classified as risky tasks while promoting good offices is classified as less risky. Knowing that peace agreements are less decisive than military victories \citep{fortna2004,david2011,walter2009}, these conflicts that demand monitoring peace agreement are likely to recur and put peacekeepers in danger. 

Monitoring a buffer agreement was explained the main body of the paper, but I will provide a brief summary. This asks is considered risky since peacekeepers are tasked to monitor and patrol a combat zone that splits the warring sides that also is likely to be the sight of any further conflict. 

Liaising war parties requires the peacekeepers to create effective lines of communication between the warring parties while also visiting their respective field headquarters. Not only are peacekeepers vulnerable when entering the respective field headquarters of the warring parties, the peacekeepers are especially at risk when visiting rebel headquarters as rebel groups are likely to observe peacekeepers as conspiring with the government. This makes the peacekeepers attractive targets for the rebel group \citep{fjelde2016}. 

The promotion of good offices, while a subtask of monitoring a peace agreement, is considered less risky. In an interview with former Deputy Special Representative to the Secretary General for the United Nations Mission in Liberia, Tamrat Samuel explains the task of promoting good offices. The task to promote good offices is another way by which a mission can find a solution for communication between the warring parties. This is a mediation role as the mission seeks to carry messages or create contact between the warring parties without directly taking part in the negotiations. The mission acts as a starting point when communication between the parties become stagnant \citep{della-giacoma_2015}. Due to the nature of this subtask, I categorize the promotion of good offices as less risky.

\subsection*{Peace Agreement Implementation}

The task to implement the peace agreement tasks monitoring the peace agreement task on step further. Following the logic presented above when explaining the risk of monitoring a peace agreement, I find that the implementation of the peace agreement to be risky as well. By specifying the need to implement the peace agreement, the mission takes an increasingly active role by enforcing the peace agreement crafted by the warring parties. Since peace agreements are less durable compared to decisive military victory \citep{fortna2004,david2011,walter2009}, I classify this task as risky. 

\subsection*{Monitor Human Rights}

The main task of monitoring human rights and its subtask of monitoring the refugee situation are classified as risky tasks. Missions tasked with the obligation to monitor human rights requires peacekeepers to investigate reports of human rights abuses. Many of these abuses that the mission monitors are by-products of conflict such as the killing of civilians \citep{hultman2013united} or their sexual exploitation and abuse \citep{johansson2019,kirschner2019}. As a result, missions are likely to move to these dangerous locations to monitor human rights abuses. With this in mind, I classify the task of monitoring human rights as a risky task.

I also classify the monitoring of the refugee situation as a risky task. Knowing that refugee movements are likely to contain rebels hiding in human camouflage, weapons, and individuals with revolutionary ideologies \citep{beardsley2011}, I believe peacekeepers are likely to be at risk when aiding refugees making this a risky task. 

\subsection*{Protect Human Rights}

I classify the main task of protecting human rights and the subtasks of protecting children, protecting women, and protecting civilians as risky tasks. As noted above, the abuse of human rights are likely to be found as by-products of conflict \citep{hultman2013united,johansson2019,kirschner2019}. Furthermore, the killing of targeting of civilians by warring parties is seen as a strategy to improve relative bargaining positions in conflict by undermining the opposing side \citep{fjelde2014,fjelde2019}. In addition, the use of sexual violence by warring parties can be used to socialize troops for high internal cohesion \citep{cohen2013}. To deter these human rights violations, especially when protecting children, women, and civilians, peacekeepers will move to locations of conflict to enforce the protection of human rights. As a result, I consider this main task and its subtasks as risky. 

\subsection*{Protect UN Personnel}

I classify the main task of protecting United Nations personnel as a risky task. Military troops can be called upon to protect United Nations personnel, such as other troop units as well as United Nations police and civilian units \citep{Infantry_2012}. Furthermore, the inclusion of the task to protect all mission personnel signals that non-armed peacekeepers may be in locations that overlap with conflict danger. As a result, I classify the protection of UN personnel as a risky task. 

\subsection*{Assist in Demining}

I classify the main task of assistance with demining to be a risky task. This task requires peacekeepers to remove landmines from the combat zones to protect civilians and other potential victims from danger. Since these mines may be hidden and remain long after the conflict subsides, peacekeepers seeking out these mines are at high risk of injury or death while seeking to remove these explosives \citep{demining}. Due to the danger associated with the demining process, I classify this task as risky. 

\subsection*{Refugees Assist}

The main task of assisting the refugee situation is classified as a risky task. Assisting with refugees exposes peacekeepers to potentially hazardous situations as refugee groups likely are host to rebels in human camouflage as well as the movement of arms \citep{beardsley2011}. Furthermore, refugee migration is associated with facilitating their movement across borders, which is a common battle ground between warring parties are rebel groups move across borders for supplies and shelter \citep{townsen2014}. As a result, I classify assisting refugees as a risky task. 

\subsection*{Facilitate the Delivery of Humanitarian Assistance}

I classify the main task of the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian assistance and its subtask of protecting humanitarian personnel as risky tasks. Humanitarian aid workers have become an increasingly vulnerable target over time, especially in the presence of battle deaths during conflict. Humanitarian aid workers are drawn to protect and help those who may be or are caught in civil conflict in addition to those who do not have necessary resources. Due to the dynamics of conflict, humanitarian aid workers are increasingly killed as a direct or indirect product of conflict \citep{hoelscher2017conflict}. Since peacekeepers are responsible to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, in addition to providing protection to these workers, I classify these tasks as risky. 

\subsection*{Monitor Borders}

I classify the main task of monitoring the host state's borders as a risky task, but I classify the subtasks of monitoring the weapons embargo, monitoring the trade of weapons, and the inspection of cargo as less risky tasks. As previously stated, host state borders are home to the facilitation of refugees that create conflict risk \citep{beardsley2011} and are the location of multiple warring party confrontations \citep{beardsley2011,townsen2014}. As a result, I classify the task of border monitoring as a risky task.

In contrast, I classify the subtasks of monitoring the weapons embargo and cargo inspections as less risky tasks. Monitoring an arms embargo and the weapons trade requires peacekeepers to deliver information on the flow of arms into the country. Most mandates are not specific in how peacekeepers are to engage with the flow of weapons outside of a verification role. Even in the case of cargo inspections, peacekeepers inspect cargo in safer locations such as sea ports, airports, and the occasional military base and host state border \citep{TAMM_Codebook}. First, the lack of specificity in mission mandates on how to carry out this task can lead to principal-agent problems as peacekeepers will likely shirk their responsibility leading to a lack of engagement with risky environments \citep{bellamy2010}. Second, the majority of locations where cargo are likely areas where conflict is less likely since private businesses prefer their cargo to reach their buyers to ensure profit \citep{morrow1998}. As a result of these considerations, I classify these subtasks as less risky. 

\subsection*{Monitor Use of Natural Resources}

I classify the task to monitor the use of natural resources as a less risky task. It is understandable that scholars may think that the monitoring of natural resources should be considered a risky task since many civil conflicts feature issues relating to the control of natural resources \citep{lujala2010,lujala2009}. However, peacekeepers are not charged with the protection and monitoring of the resources, but rather with the responsibility to provide advice to governments on how to manage their natural resources \citep{res_2556}. Instead of taking enforcement role, peacekeepers are to take an advisory role. As a result, I classify this task as a less risky task.

\subsection*{Chapter VII Authorization}

I classify the task of Chapter VII authorization as a risky task. The United Nations Security Council provides Chapter VII authorization to use force in the development and duration of peace. Providing this task allow the mission to take overt military action to combat threats to peace allowing for mandate implementation with more force compared to Chapter VI authorized missions \citep{PKO_Ox}. Due to the authorization of the use of overt military action and the implementation of mandates by the use of force, I classify Chapter VII authorization as risky. 

\subsection*{Elections}

I classify that main tasks of monitoring elections, providing security for the elections, and assisting with election implementation as less risky tasks. The action of monitoring elections requires peacekeepers to support in manners such as providing technological, logistical, and administrative support to ensure that the election process is smooth. For assisting with the election implementation, the peacekeepers have a more active role by assisting the acting government to organize, monitor, and carry out elections \citep{TAMM_Codebook}. The actions of monitoring and supporting the election do not put peacekeepers in active danger making these less risky tasks. 

Following the classification of the other election related tasks, I classify the provision of election security as a less risky task. Peacekeepers charged with electoral security raise the costs of groups attempting to perpetrate election violence whether through reputational or implementation costs creating a strong deterrent effect on election violence \citep{fjelde2020election}. Furthermore, elections are likely to take place in areas of high population density. Due to the large grouping of civilians in cities as well as their likely access to transportation, peacekeepers are likely congregated in mass where elections are to take place \citep{townsen2014}. As a result, I classify election security as a less risky task. 

\subsection*{Build Government Capacity}

I classify the main task of building government capacity and the subtask of the implementation of government policies as less risky tasks. In peacekeeping mandates, peacekeepers are given the responsibility to re-establish government authority, especially through the use of political and administrative reform. Furthermore, when missions have the responsibility to implement these reforms, they are still likely to pertain to the administrative spheres of the government \citep{TAMM_Codebook}. Due to the limitation of peacekeepers to assist in the development of the government following an administrative capacity, I classify these tasks as less risky. 

\subsection*{Preserve Cultural and Historical Sites}

I classify the protection of cultural heritage sites to be a less risky task. This task requests that peacekeepers assist, when necessary and feasible, to protect cultural and historical sites alongside government authorities and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) \citep{TAMM_Codebook}. The task to protect cultural sites has two important qualities that make this task less risky. First, peacekeepers are to assist the host government and UNESCO instead of being the main enforcers of cultural site protection. Second, the task should only be carried out when necessary and feasible suggesting that this is not a high priority task and should limit peacekeeper exposure to danger. As a result, I classify the protection of cultural and historical sites as a less risky task. 

\subsection*{Assist in the Implementation of Quick Impact Projects (QIP)}

I classify the task to assist with the implementation of Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) as a less risky task. QIPs are initiatives funded by the mission to assist local communities. These actions include renovating schools and providing safety for accessing fresh water. Missions can use QIPs to create weapons-free zones, but they also include the construction of solar-powered water systems \citep{QIP}. QIPs seek to develop local communities after the decaying effects of civil conflict allowing the mission to reach out to impacted communities instead of engaging with warring parties. As a result, I classify the tasks of QIP implementation as less risky. 

\subsection*{Assist with Justice Sector Reform}

I classify the task to assist with justice sector reform as a less risky task. The Untied Nations pushes missions with this tasks to develop the justice system, strength criminal justice prosecution, and facilitate rule of law reforms. Many of these factors deal with educating state actors, such as judges, to understand the law, increase accountability and monitoring to find those who break the law, and ensure the cost of punishment for breaking the law offsets the benefits of breaking the law \citep{blair2021}. Due to the educator and reformer role of the mission, I classify this task as less risky. 

\subsection*{Assist with Security Sector Reform}

I classify the main task of assisting with security sector reform and its subtasks of assisting police reform, monitoring the police, and conducting joint patrols with the police as risky tasks. With this main task, peacekeepers must work alongside an institutions that likely was used as an offensive military tool against warring parties as well as citizens by the government. Peacekeepers have to reform the security sector into an accountable institution instead of one that targets civilians and rebel groups \citep{lloyd_diss}. By reforming the government's security forces while also assisting the government in the investigation and tracking of culpable rebel groups, peacekeepers are put in danger making this a risky task. 

The subtasks of assisting police reform, monitoring the police, and conducting joint patrols with the police follow a similar logic and outcome as risky tasks. Assisting the police requires peacekeepers to not only impart principles and best practices to develop quality law enforcement, but it also requires peacekeepers to work alongside the police to create and enforce a peaceful environment that can put peacekeepers at risk of injury or death. Monitoring the police requires peacekeepers to carryout police reform among the police units, but also to constituting units of the police force. This further puts peacekeepers at risk of harm. Last, conducting joint patrols with the police requires troops to work alongside the police in the monitoring and patrolling of dangerous locations with high levels of crime, suggesting continued risk to troop physical integrity \citep{TAMM_Codebook}. As a result, I classify these subtasks as risky. 

\subsection*{Promote National Reconciliation}

I classify the main task of promoting national reconciliation and its subtask of pursuing justice for war criminals as a less risky task. The process of national reconciliation is a political action to promote trust between the warring parties to solve the social tensions that lead to conflict. The peacekeepers attempt to connect local mediation to national political processes \citep{Pol_Sol}. Due to its political and social nature, I classify this task as less risky. 

I classify the subtask of pursuing justice for war criminals as a less risky task. With this task, peacekeepers take an investigative role to search for those implicated as human rights violators. Instead of looking to combat these individuals, the peacekeepers look to investigate crimes and assist police units in bringing in criminals \citep{TAMM_Codebook}. With this in mind, I classify this subtask as a less risky task. 

\subsection*{Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR)}

I classify the main tasks of monitoring disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) and the main task of assisting with DDR as risky tasks. DDR takes weapons that are given up by former armed groups and aids in their reintegration into society with some joining the government armed forces. Peacekeepers must deal directly with armed groups in order to carry out this task putting the troops in a precarious situation \citep{DDR}. Peacekeeping troops are not likely to be responsible for the placement of former combatants into programs to develop job skills, but they are more responsible to gather information on the DDR program, guard weapon and ammunition stockpiles from would-be spoilers, providing safe transportation of weapons, and proactively engage with warring parties \citep{Infantry_2012}. As a result of the high potential to engage with frustrated armed combatants and would-be spoilers attempting to take valuable weapons and ammunition, I classify the monitoring and assisting with DDR tasks as risky. 

\subsection*{Disseminate Info About the Mission to the Public}

I classify the main task of disseminating info about the mission the public as a less risky task. In role, peacekeepers act as information sharing agents. The mission communicates to the local communities and the warring parties about the role of the mission through information sharing mechanisms such as radio broadcasts and community outreach \citep{TAMM_Codebook}. Due to the community outreach nature of this task, I classify this task as less risky. 

\subsection*{Promote Freedom of the Press}

I classify the main task to promote freedom of the press as a less risky task. Peacekeepers charged with this task have the responsibility to strengthen the legal and regulation frameworks that protect the media and other forms of societal communication. In addition to protecting the media from outside influence, peacekeepers are charged to aid in the professionalization of the media to produce quality publications \citep{TAMM_Codebook}. Due to the legal reformation approach of peacekeepers, I classify this task as less risky.
