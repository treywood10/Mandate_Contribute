# Mandate_Contribute

Welcome to my repository! This repository hosts my research protect entitled "UN-Interested Suppliers: Effects of Peacekeeping Mandates on Contributions." This project is the first empirical chapter of my dissertation where I investigate how the level of risk associated with a peacekeeping mission mandate reduces peacekeeping troop contributions. I include the dataset, the code associated with making and analyzing the dataset, as well as a full draft of the project. It is currently under review for publication. 

In this project, I use STATA and R. I use STATA to build and analyze my dataset. I employ R to generate substantive effects by simulating coefficients to estimate predicted counts of peacekeeper contributions from contributing states.
